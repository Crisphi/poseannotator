## To Do's

* support single-file json annotations
* pretty user interface

* possibility of adding new points without violating bodyschema rules --> fix new issues

## Things to think about

* How do we want to proceed with confidence levels? Do we overwrite them?
* In which format should the new annotations be saved? In one single JSON file? Should all JSON files be saved or just the ones that have changed?
